### Introduction

PiNe provides a containerized system to put some web services online. PiNe is also a simple way to keep the entire system updated, maintained and isolated from underlying system. Using PiNe is also usefull to keep each contaier isolated for others, in this way if a fault is rised in one of them, the others continue to run. The system is based on the [Docker-CE][1] engine from a maintainer idea after struggling with the same services hosted directetly on the OS.

- [Plex][3]: a Media Server
