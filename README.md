## Introduction

*HomeHub* provides a containerized system to put some web services online. HomeHub is also a simple way to keep the entire system updated, maintained and isolated from underlying machine. Using HomeHub is also usefull to keep each contaier isolated for others, in this way if a fault is rised in one of them, the others continue to run. The system is based on the [Docker-CE][1] engine from a maintainer idea after struggling with the same services hosted directetly on the OS.


### Description

HomeHbu containes
- <u>[SQLHub](#SQLHub)</u>: a relational DBMS
- <u>[FTPHub](#FTPHub)</u>: a File Transfer Protocol server
- <u>[Plex*][3]</a></u>: a Media Server
- <u>[BoxHub](#BoxHub)</u>: a cloud service
- <u>[HostHub](#HostHub)</u>: a hosting for sites building, testing and presentation

All containers based on `HTTP` protocol are accessible using a ReverseProxy over SSL encryption but without registered certificate by CA.

<br/><br/>

#### _SQLHub_

SQLHub is a relational database management system based on `mariadb` engine. SQLHub is used by all others services communicating through underlying network provided by the docker engine, in this way all communications stay into the system and aren't visible from outside. <br/>
At image building time, the system uses the root password and the new user credential saved in the `.env` file. This file has to be created before to run the building process using this syntax:
```
ROOT_PSWD=<root password>
USR=<new username>
PSWD=<`USR` password>
```


#### _FTPHub_

The server FTP is based on `vsftpd` engine. At the image building time, the system copies the configuration files and the configuration script into the image.<br/>
Into the `vsftpd` configuration file, called `vsftpd.conf`, are setted the environment variables, like the writting permissions, users list and `chroot` to restrict users to thier home directory.<br/>
Instead, into the `configFile.conf` there are the users name and users password required to configure the entire system using the script `config.sh`.<br/>
Into the `vsftpd.userlist` there is the list of the signup users with the permissions to loggedin.
